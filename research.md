Broadly, I am interested in uncovering the genetic architecture of complex traits. What excites me most is understanding what role the environment plays in trait expression, particularly how historical selection has led to local adaptation, or when populations become adapted to their local environments and outperform individuals from outside their range, and how we can exploit the genomic features underpinning environmental adaptation to breed plants that perform well in target environments. </p>

## Genetic Architecture of Complex Traits

<p align="justify">
Dissecting the genetic architecture of complex traits is vital for making rapid and sustained genetic gain in breeding programs and to ensure the health and persistence of natural populations. Ultimately, the goals of my research are to facilitate breeding and conservation efforts by studying the genetic basis of the interaction between genetics and the environment and identifying important alleles for key traits. During my PhD, I used data collected from over a decade of potato breeding efforts to map alleles underlying local adaptation and genotype-by-environment interactions (GxE) and understand how they influence phenotypic variance in elite lines. As a postdoc I took a more fine-grained approach, identifying transposable elements (TEs) contributing to GxE in maize. TEs make up 85% (!) of the maize genome, but traditional bioinformatics pipelines makes directly studying their effects difficult. By developing a novel method to map TEs in the genome using short-read sequencing data, we were able to identify TEs that had substantial effects on both trait means and GxE across diverse environments.

## Evolution Across Space and Time

How plant populations have responded to historical selection is an important area of study, allowing researchers to predict future responses and understand how (and to what extent) evolutionary and demographic processes have shaped the natural world. It is especially important that we understand how anthropogenic climate change and changes in land-use have influenced the evolutionary trajectories of plant populations as deeper knowledge of their effect will give us the information we need to mitigate their negative effects. During my PhD, I used a novel experimental design to study how domestication and polyploid interact to shape how plants respond to their environment. Polyploidy is often viewed as conferring environmental "robustness," but there is little empirical evidence for this in the literature. Conversely, domestication has often led to plants being more sensitive to environmental stress. By using a factorial design of domesticated and wild species of potato from multiple ploidy levels, I investigated whether polyploidy acted to protect domesticated potato from losing its ability to respond to the environment. My postdoc has focused on developing tools for understanding plant adaptation. I developed and validated a new statistical test of selection for GxE across spatially-segregating populations. Presently, I am working on building a statistical framework for studying the evolution of plant populations using data from herbarium specimens. Herbaria hold vast collections of plant tissue collected over the last several centuries. New sequencing technologies make it possible to genotype these specimens and advancements in image and chemical analysis have opened the door to quickly generate trait data. I hope to open the door for more research utilizing herbarium specimens, letting researchers look back in time at the evolutionary process at a much finer scale. Connecting those discoveries to changes in the environment will reveal how plants are responding to human activities and provide the information necessary to breed robust crops and ensure the persistence of natural populations.
