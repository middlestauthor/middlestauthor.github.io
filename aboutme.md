<p align="justify">
Hello! I'm a Postdoc at Michigan State University in the lab of Emily Josephs. Broadly, I'm interested in using statistics, population genetics, and quantitative genetics to dissect the genetic basis of complex traits, the underlying evolutionary and demographic processes underpinning adaptive divergence between populations spanning large spatial and temporal scales, and how we can use this information to inform breeding and conservation efforts in the face of climate change and urbanization.</p>

Presently, I am developing a statistical framework to study the evolution of complex traits using herbarium specimens. Herbarium collections are a vast resource of plant tissue collected from the last several centuries from across the globe. Herbarium specimens provide a snapshot into the evolutionary history of plant populations and researchers are increasingly genotyping and phenotyping them to gain a deeper understanding of how populations have evolved in response to changing environments. I also worked on projects to map genotype-by-environment interactions to structural variants (particularly transposable elements or "jumping genes") in maize and helped develop a statistical model to identify selection for adaptive divergence between populations. </p>

Prior to joining the lab at MSU, I completed a **PhD in Plant and Microbial Genetics** at the University of Minnesota. My dissertation work focused on understanding the genetic basis of genotype-by-environment interactions, local adaptation, and phenotypic plasticity in domesticated potato and its wild relatives. Potato is the most widely-grown vegetable crop in the world and understanding how the environment shapes trait variation is vital for breeding new varieties that are robust to climate change. During my PhD, I learned a ton about the statistical analysis of complex traits and how to turn basic scientific research into breeding progress. That experience instilled in me a love for working at the interface between basic and applied scientific research. </p>

I received my **BA in Classical Humanities** with a Minor in Biology at the University of Missouri. How did I go from studying art and history of the ancient world to quantitative plant genetics? Well, happenstance put me in a Plant Biology department seminar and I was blown away by the research, even if I barely understood it at the time. I connected with the speaker, a USDA researcher and adjunct faculty member at Mizzou, and he invited me to join his lab. That experience instilled in me a love for research and inspired me to continue unconvering the connection between quantitative genetics and the vast variation throughout the plant kingdom. The rest is history! </p>
